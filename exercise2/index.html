	<p class="rob">Rob Schmitz</p>
		<p class="rob-small">One of the big things that didn't sit right with me came early on in Daisey's monologue, when he talks about arriving at the gates of the Foxconn factory.</p>

	<p class="mike">Mike Daisey</p>
		<p class="mike-small">And I get out of the taxi with my translator. And the first thing I see at the gates are the guards. And the guards look pissed. They look really pissed. And they are carrying guns.</p>

	<p class="rob">Rob Schmitz</p>
		<p class="rob-small">I've done reporting at a lot of Chinese factories and I've never seen guards with guns. The only people allowed to have guns in China are the military and the police, not factory guards. Later, Daisey meets with factory workers, who he says belong to an illegal union, one that's not authorized by the Chinese government.</p>

	<p class="mike">Mike Daisey</p>
		<p class="mike-small">And I say to them, "How do you know who's right to work with? How do you find people to help you organize?" And they look at each other bashfully. And they say, "Well, we talk a lot. We have lots of meetings. And we meet at coffeehouses and different Starbucks in Guangzhou. And we exchange papers."</p>

	<p class="rob">Rob Schmitz</p>
		<p class="rob-small">Wait, hold on. Rewind.</p>

	<p class="mike">Mike Daisey</p>
	<p class="mike-small">We meet at coffeehouses and different Starbucks in Guangzhou.</p>

	<p class="rob">Rob Schmitz</p>
		<p class="rob-small">Factory workers who make $15, $20 a day are sipping coffee at Starbucks? Starbucks is pricier in China than in the US. A reporter friend of mine didn't believe this either. He said Chinese factory workers gathering at Starbucks is sort of like United Auto Workers in Detroit holding their meetings at a Chinese tea house.</p>
