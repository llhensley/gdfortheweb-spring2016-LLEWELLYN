div draws a box around something; can put a border to see the extents

width: 80%;

(to center)
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;

CMD+/ = quickly comment out in css

margin and padding
margin is space around something (around div)
padding is space inside something (inside div)

margin: 10% (could help center div)

using pixels vs %
problems using both
try to use relative units (%) rather than absolute units

for instance
rems (units by type size)
type-size:18px; (set base font size)
20rem 40rem
REM relative ot base type size
EM _relative to font size of parent element

MEDIA QUERY;
RESPONSIVE DESIGN SO THAT THE SIZE DECREASES WHEN SCREEN SIZE DECREASED
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
	html {
		font-size: 12px
	}
}

MOBILE FIRST probably not a standard best practice


DIV JAMS
.has-border {
	
}

.has-bg {
	
}

<div class="has-border has-bg"></div>

what appears last in css file will override WHAT came before
