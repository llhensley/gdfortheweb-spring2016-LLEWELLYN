div draws a box around something; can put a border to see the extents

width: 80%;

(to center)
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;

CMD+/ = quickly comment out in css

margin and padding
margin is space around something (around div)
padding is space inside something (inside div)

margin: 10% (could help center div)

using pixels vs %
problems using both
try to use relative units (%) rather than absolute units

for instance
rems (units by type size)
type-size:18px; (set base font size)
20rem 40rem
REM relative ot base type size
EM _relative to font size of parent element

MEDIA QUERY;
RESPONSIVE DESIGN SO THAT THE SIZE DECREASES WHEN SCREEN SIZE DECREASED
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
	html {
		font-size: 12px
	}
}

MOBILE FIRST probably not a standard best practice


DIV JAMS
.has-border {
	
}

.has-bg {
	
}

<div class="has-border has-bg"></div>

what appears last in css file will override WHAT came before

nth child
.class:state (ex hover)
:visited ()
:active (when link is pushed)
:before

NAV
<nav>
</nav>

OVERLAP: put in separate divs and have them overlap


ANTI–SEMANTICS ??? vs anti-semitic


RESET CSS

TITLE TAG
<title>this is a title</title>
(makes shit look more profesh)

<!-- WRITE ONE CSS FILE FOR THE ENTIRE WEBSITE -->

<a></a>
<span></span>
<a href="#"> ???

avoid repeating yourself
set font in body

CNTL K ?

body {
	font-family: Helvetica, sans–serif;
	font-weight; normal;
	line-height: 1.4 <!-- (1.4x font size) -->;

}

link under body <a> </a>

set up a default; then have special cases (classes) be the exceptions

p {
	indent-
}

remove shit that is not doing anything

make div to control spaces between sections//

POSITIONING

FLOATS
if you use it, don't use other positioning
if things are not floating, they will stack

INLINE BLOCK

OR

POSITION
if you use it, don't use floats

absolute
	top
	left

fixed (wont move when you scroll the page; 
for header to stay in one place and NOT SCROLL)

relative (relative to where it would have been –it's normal position–)

Z INDEX
