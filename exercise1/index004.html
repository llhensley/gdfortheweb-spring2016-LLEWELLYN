					<a href="index005.html">Tigers walk behind me–</a>
				</h3>
				<h4>they are to remind me that</h4>
				<h5>I'm lost– but I'm not afraid</h5>
		</p>

				<h5>Soul to soul– A kiss and a sigh</h5>
				<h4>Sawed in half– by the passage of time</h4>
				<h3>Halfway home– from a window you see</h3>
			    <h2>Chains and bars– but I am still free</h2>
				<h1>People on the outside–</h1>
				<h2>I remember sweet times</h2>
				<h3>This old rose– is always in bloom</h3>
				<h4>Everyone is happy– to be a baby daddy</h4>
				<h5>Stone love– with nothing to lose</h5>

			    <h4>Life is long- if you give it way</h4>
			    <h3>So stay, don't go– cause I'm fading away</h3>
			    <h2>Soul to soul- between you and me</h2>
			    <h1>Chain me down– but I am still free</h1>

				<h2>Now I can say– those three little words</h2>
				<h3>And every day– I'm dreaming a world</h3>
				<h4>Soul to soul– a kiss and a sigh</h4>
				<h5>Holding back– the waters outside.</h5>

			    <h4>Life is long– if you give it way</h4>
			    <h3>So stay, don't go– cause I'm fading away</h3>
			    <h2>Soul to soul– between you and me</h2>
